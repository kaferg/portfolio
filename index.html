                    <h3>To me, coding is <em>magical</em>.</h3>
                    <p>Being able to type commands to create a beautiful website is one of the coolest thigns I've learned how to do!  Now that I have these skills, I like to use them to help small business owners and non-profits create the perfect website for their needs.</p>
                    <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I like to spend time with my husband and our furry baby (guinea pig), Chewy. I have many hobbies, but some of my favorite things to do include: singing my heart out, traveling the world, curling up with a good book, seeing the latest movies, and playing all sorts of games (yes, I still occasionally play the Sims).</p>
